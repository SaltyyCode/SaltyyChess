# SaltyyChess (And soon SaltyyBot v1 I hope)

This project is my very first personal python project* during my first year in computer science !

The goal of this project is making my own chess board, with all chess rules, and then create my own chess engine with an elo greater than 1700 (on chess.com standings not FIDE one).

For now I'm still working on the chess board, with left to include rules about check(mate) / pins / castle / en-passant ect.. (I only have legals moves for all pieces and undo / redo) *08/03/2024 4:14 am*


## Installation

Install Python latest version and Pygame library

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SaltyyCode/SaltyyChess.git
```

## Usage
Run the program using python or python3 command 
```
python .\src\main.py  
```

## Also
I have been passionate about chess for the last 4 years, playing a lot of games and reading a lot about game theory (heres my chess.com account : https://www.chess.com/member/saltyypro).
After looking a great video serie of https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague, where here makes his own chess engine and then run a tournament with other people own made bots (heres the video look at it ! They are a huge source of inspiration : https://youtu.be/_vqlIPDR2TU?si=hU3OGR-EAz8wl7zm & https://youtu.be/_vqlIPDR2TU?si=yqGfmje-dYMvyfsF & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk)

So basicaly all this project is about me wanting to make my own chess engine, that i'd train and play against in order to create my own engine capable of beating myself.
It is the most logical way for me to combine my newest passion for code and my chess one :D

*re: I'm only studying C in my school so all Python is self-taught*
